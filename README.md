Project Description:
Developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze key workforce metrics, employee attrition trends, and performance indicators. The dataset included 1,480 records with 38 attributes, covering employee demographics, job satisfaction, salary details, and work-life balance.

Key Features:
1. Attrition Analysis: Identified factors influencing employee turnover based on age, department, and job role.
2. Salary & Performance Insights: Visualized relationships between salary slabs, job levels, and performance ratings.
3. Workforce Demographics: Created interactive visualizations for age groups, education fields, and gender distribution.
4. Employee Satisfaction Metrics: Analyzed work-life balance, job satisfaction, and training frequency.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Interactive Dashboards)
Excel/Pandas (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)
SQL (Data Querying & Filtering) (if applicable)

This project showcases my ability to analyze HR data, derive meaningful insights, and create interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.
